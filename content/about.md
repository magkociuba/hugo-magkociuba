Cześć! Hello! Hola! Halo!

My name is Magdalena, in Poland we say Magda :)


I love to live life, meet new people and explore the world. My friends say I have a soul of traveler and a mindest of engineer - I just try to be myself. Probably connecting both is part of my personality because recently I spent most of my time on international projects devoted to engineering. 


During my BSc and MSc studies I had an opportunity to participate in fascinating engineering internships at Cargotec (Stargard, Poland), Biofur Truck Engineering (Valencia, Spain) and Bridgestone (Stargard, Poland). I've also spent one semester of my studies on Erasmus exchange in Ljubljana, Slovenia and participated in Work and Travel Program (New Jersey, US). Feel welcomed to read more about [my work experience](magkociuba.github.io/experience) and [passion](magkociuba.github.io/passion).

In my spare time I develop several international projects devoted to management and logistics. Moreover, I have a pleasure to lead Job Raising Group at intenational student association - IAESTE Politechnika Gdańska. Find more about my projects below:

Current experience and extensive involvement in university and extracurricular courses allows me to continuely develop my language skills - that's a great fun! It's also a really practical skillset while keeping contact with friends all over the world. That's amazing to learn about different cultures, habbits and cuisines, isn't it? 

Mówię po / I speak / Yo hablo / Ich spreche:

* Polish (natively)
* English (C2)
* Spanish (B2)
* German (B1)

I live in Poland and plan to stay in Gdańsk for the next couple of years because this town makes me smile all the time! I would like to continue my professional carrer in Trójmiasto and currently I'm looking for opportunities in logistics engineering and project management.

Interested in collaboration? Let's work together! Just send me an [email](mailto:magdalena.kociuba95@gmail.com) and I'll do my best to help!
